    "# Processing New Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the trained Logistic Regression model to make predictions on new data. Follow these steps to process your new data and obtain predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the Trained Model and Scaler**:\n",
    "   - The model and scaler are loaded from the `model` directory. The scaler ensures that the new data is preprocessed in the same way as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load and Preprocess New Data**:\n",
    "   - New data is loaded from the `new_data` directory.\n",
    "   - Categorical variables are converted into dummy variables.\n",
    "   - The notebook reindexes the new data to ensure it has the same columns as the training data, which is crucial for accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scale the Data**:\n",
    "   - The new data is scaled using the loaded scaler to match the feature scaling applied during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Make Predictions**:\n",
    "   - Predictions are made using the loaded model.\n",
    "   - Prediction probabilities for the positive class are also calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save and View Results**:\n",
    "   - The results are saved to `new_data/predictions.csv`.\n",
    "   - A preview of the predictions and probabilities is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that your new data file is in the correct format and directory before running this notebook.\n",
